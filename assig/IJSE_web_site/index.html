        <h3>We are the only Oracle Education/Technology provider in Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>It is since the year 2006 that we have been performing the task of educating students in order to prepare them for Oracle Examinations (previously presented by the Sun Microsystem). We are the only institute that carries out this process in a manner that truly produces a programmer who can face any real world problem rather than making our training just an exam oriented set of sessions where it is only the examination questions that are discussed equipping the students for the exam but no further. Our system of education has been able to create fully fledged programmers who excel in both theoretical and practical knowledge out of thousands of undergraduates. Our institute has been able to turn over as much as four thousand undergraduate students for the Oracle Examinations where they have displayed results that are rarely produced by any other Oracle educator in the world making IJSE without doubt the perfect choice for obtaining a recognized Software Engineering degree in Sri Lanka.

            <h3>10th Anniversary</h3>
            <p>In last 10 years had produced 4200 software engineers to the nation....!

                IJSE was started on the 10th January of 2006 in Panadura, opening doors for the younger generation to materialize their dream of becoming a software engineering / quality assurance Engineer through providing recognized qualifications in IT and Software Engineering. At the start IJSE marched forward with a highly dedicated team of ten individuals whose hard work resulted in opening the second branch in Galle. Within this short period of time, IJSE has achieved a leading position among the providers of Software Engineering degrees in Sri Lanka.

                The uniqueness of realizing the demanded programmers and IJSE’s infinite flexibilities to explore new ways and best products could mark the journey a fast moving result oriented one. This achievement in short has made our degree in software engineering highly desired and sought after out of all other IT and Computer Science degrees in Sri Lanka. The Committed individuals of our team and student centered values have brought IJSE from 30 to 700 students following our various courses in IT and Software Engineering. Our records have indicated that we had produced more than 4200 valuable software engineering professionals to the nation, and as a Sri Lankan IT education Institute we are proud to say that, many students of our first batch were recruited by most prestigious software companies in Sri Lanka placing us above all other IT course providers from the very beginning of our journey as an institute for higher education in software engineering and IT/Computer Science.
